4 out of 6 workshops are completed! Yesterday I held the fourth [on-line hands-on workshop](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo/events/273877976/) under my [Infrastructure as Code user group](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo).

This time it was about how to implement immutable infrastructure on Azure with [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) - an open source infrastructure as code tool for creating, deploying, and managing cloud infrastructure.

8 labs, super awesome participants, 4 hours of pure hands-on work.

As always, all labs are [available](https://github.com/evgenyb/iac-meetup/tree/master/workshops/04-implement-immutable-infrastructure-on-azure-with-pulumi-part-II) and you are welcome to try them.

Labs from my previous workshops:

* [Workshop #1: How to live in harmony with ARM templates](https://borzenin.com/iac-ws1-labs/)
* [Workshop #2: Implement immutable infrastructure on Azure with ARM templates](https://borzenin.com/iac-ws2-labs/)
* [Workshop #3: Implement immutable infrastructure with Pulumi: Part I](https://borzenin.com/iac-ws3-labs/)

Next in the pipeline for 2020:

* November 2020 - Workshop #5: Terraform 101
* December 2020 - Workshop #6: Implementing Immutable Infrastructure on Azure with Terraform

If you have any issues/comments/suggestions related to the labs, you can reach out to me at evgeny.borzenin@gmail.com.

With that - thanks for reading!
