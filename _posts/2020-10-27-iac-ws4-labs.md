4 out of 6 workshops are completed! Yesterday I held the fourth [on-line hands-on workshop](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo/events/273877976/) under my [Infrastructure as Code user group](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo).

This time it was about how to implement immutable infrastructure on Azure with [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) - an open source infrastructure as code tool for creating, deploying, and managing cloud infrastructure.

8 labs, super awesome participants, 4 hours of pure hands-on work.

As always, all labs are [available](https://github.com/evgenyb/iac-meetup/tree/master/workshops/04-implement-immutable-infrastructure-on-azure-with-pulumi-part-II) and you are welcome to try them.
