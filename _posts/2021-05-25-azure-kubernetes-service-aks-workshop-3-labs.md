This week I held [Implement Immutable AKS Infrastructure on Azure with Bicep](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo/events/277902947/) workshop under my [Infrastructure as Code user group](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo).

This time, we worked with [Azure Bicep](https://github.com/Azure/bicep) - a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for deploying Azure resources declaratively and since this year is all about AKS, we used Bicep to implement immutable AKS infrastructure on Azure.

If you didn't attend this workshop, labs are [available](https://github.com/evgenyb/aks-workshops/tree/main/03-immutable-aks-infrastructure-with-bicep) and you are welcome to work with them.
