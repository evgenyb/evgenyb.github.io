Yesterday I held [Advanced AKS Configuration](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo/events/277127499/) workshop under my [Infrastructure as Code user group](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo).

This time, the focus was on advanced configuration aspects of AKS cluster and attendees learned:

* how to deploy AKS into your Private Virtual Network
* how to configure multiple node pools for system and user workloads
* how to deploy `aad-pod-identity` and how to enable pod identity for your applications
* how to deploy and configure nginx ingress controller and how to configure ingress for your services
* how to configure egress traffic
* how to expose your AKS publicly with Azure API Management

10 labs 100% hands-on, 4 hours and absolutely awesome participants!
