Yesterday I held [Load-Balancing Options on Azure](https://www.meetup.com/infrastructure-as-code-user-group-oslo/events/291342632/) workshop under my [Infrastructure as Code user group](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo).

This time we looked at load-balancing options available on Azure and learned:

* What load-balancing options are available on Azure
* How to choose a load balancing solution for your workloads
* What traffic routing methods are available at Azure Front Door
* How to implement canary releases with Azure Traffic Manager
* How to rewrite HTTP headers and URL with Azure Application Gateway

and many many more...
