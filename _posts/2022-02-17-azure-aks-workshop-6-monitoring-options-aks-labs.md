Last week I held [Monitoring options in AKS](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo/events/283137161/) workshop under my [Infrastructure as Code user group](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo).

That was an introduction level workshop that covered monitoring aspects of AKS and we learned:

* What kind monitoring options are available for AKS
* How to monitor AKS with Azure Monitor
* How to collect Prometheus Metrics with Azure Monitor without deploying Prometheus components into your cluster
* How to monitor AKS with Prometheus and Grafana
* How to query and visualize Azure Monitor Logs and Metrics in Grafana with Azure Monitor Data Source

As always, labs are [available](https://github.com/evgenyb/aks-workshops/tree/main/06-monitoring-options-in-aks) and you are welcome to work with them.
