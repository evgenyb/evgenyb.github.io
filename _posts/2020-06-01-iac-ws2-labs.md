Last week I hosted my second [on-line hands-on workshop](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo/events/270624160/) under my [Infrastructure as Code user group](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo) at the series of 6 workshops I am planning to host in 2020.

This time it was 10 labs, 20 awesome participants, 4 hours of pure hands-on work.

If you want to learn some basics about how to work with ARM templates, try to work with [11 labs from workshop #1](https://github.com/evgenyb/iac-meetup/blob/master/workshops/01-how-to-live-in-harmony-with-ARM-templates/agenda.md).

If you want to practice your ARM template knowledge, try to implement immutable infrastructure on Azure using [10 labs from workshop #2](https://github.com/evgenyb/iac-meetup/tree/master/workshops/02-implement-azure-infrastructure-with-arm-templates).

If you have any issues/comments/suggestions related to the labs, you can reach out to me at evgeny.borzenin@gmail.com.

With that - thanks for reading!
