Back in November 2021 I held [GitOps in AKS with Flux](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo/events/280664424/) workshop under my [Infrastructure as Code user group](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo).

This time it was all about GitOps and we covered the basics of GitOps in Kubernetes with Flux and attendees learned:

* How to install Flux to AKS cluster
* How to configure Flux with your git repositories
* How to continuously deliver infrastructure and workloads changes defined with Kubernetes manifests (and assembled with Kustomize)
* How to declaratively manage Helm chart releases with Kubernetes manifests
* Different ways how you can structure your repositories
* How to upgrade and monitor flux

If you didn't attend this workshop, labs are [available](https://github.com/evgenyb/aks-workshops/tree/main/04-gitops-in-aks-with-flux) and you are welcome to work with them.
