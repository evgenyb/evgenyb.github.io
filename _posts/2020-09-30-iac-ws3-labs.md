Yesterday I held the third [on-line hands-on workshop](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo/events/272952783/) under my [Infrastructure as Code user group](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo) at the series of 6 workshops I am planning to host in 2020.

This time it was about [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) - an open source infrastructure as code tool for creating, deploying, and managing cloud infrastructure.

8 labs, 20 awesome participants, 4 hours of pure hands-on work.

All labs are [available](https://github.com/evgenyb/iac-meetup/tree/master/workshops/03-implement-immutable-infrastructure-on-azure-with-pulumi) and you are welcome to try them.

Labs from my previous workshops:

* [Workshop #1: How to live in harmony with ARM templates](https://borzenin.com/iac-ws1-labs/)
* [Workshop #2: Implement immutable infrastructure on Azure with ARM templates](https://borzenin.com/iac-ws2-labs/)

Here is the plan for the next workshops:

* 27 October - Workshop #4: Implement immutable infrastructure on Azure with Pulumi - Part II
* November 2020 - Workshop #5: Terraform 101
* December 2020 - Workshop #6: Implementing Immutable Infrastructure on Azure with Terraform

If you have any issues/comments/suggestions related to the labs, you can reach out to me at evgeny.borzenin@gmail.com.

With that - thanks for reading!
