Yesterday I held the third [on-line hands-on workshop](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo/events/272952783/) under my [Infrastructure as Code user group](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo) at the series of 6 workshops I am planning to host in 2020.

This time it was about [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) - an open source infrastructure as code tool for creating, deploying, and managing cloud infrastructure.

8 labs, 20 awesome participants, 4 hours of pure hands-on work.

All labs are [available](https://github.com/evgenyb/iac-meetup/tree/master/workshops/03-implement-immutable-infrastructure-on-azure-with-pulumi) and you are welcome to try them.
