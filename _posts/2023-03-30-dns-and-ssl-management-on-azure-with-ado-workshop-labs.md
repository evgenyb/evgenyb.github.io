Last week I held [Automate DNS and Certificate management on Azure with Azure DevOps](https://www.meetup.com/infrastructure-as-code-user-group-oslo/events/291966072) workshop under my [Infrastructure as Code user group](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo).

This time we looked at different aspects of automating DNS and certificate management on Azure with Azure DNS Zone, keyvault-acmebot and Azure DevOps and we learned:

- How to delegate domain to Azure DNS Zone
- How to automate DNS records management with Azure DevOps
- What options are available on Azure to maintain SSL certificates
- How to automate [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate management with [keyvault-acmebot](https://github.com/shibayan/keyvault-acmebot)

and many many more...

As always, labs are [available](https://github.com/evgenyb/iac-workshops/tree/main/dns-and-ssl-management-on-azure-with-ado) and you are welcome to work with them.
