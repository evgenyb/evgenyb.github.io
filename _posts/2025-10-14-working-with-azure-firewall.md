Yesterday I held [Working with Azure Firewall](https://www.meetup.com/infrastructure-as-code-user-group-oslo/events/310978003) Workshop under [Infrastructure as Code user group Oslo](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo).

This time we looked at different aspects of working with `Azure Firewall` and learned:

- What is Azure Firewall
- What are the common use cases for Azure Firewall
- How to deploy and configure Azure Firewall with hub-and-spoke topology
- How Azure Firewall policies are structured
- How to create and manage Network and Application rules
- What is SNAT port exhaustion and how to mitigate it
- How to monitor Azure Firewall with logs and metrics

and much more...

As always, labs are [available](https://workshops.iac-labs.com/azure-firewall-labs/) and you are welcome to work with them.
