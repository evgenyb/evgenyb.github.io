Last week I held [Scaling options for applications and clusters in AKS](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo/events/283137120/) workshop under my [Infrastructure as Code user group](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo).

This time we focused on scaling in AKS and learned:

* What kind of scaling options are available for applications and clusters in AKS
* How to manually scale pods and how Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) works
* How to manually scale nodes and how cluster autoscaler works
* What is Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaler ([KEDA](https://keda.sh/)) and how to use it to scale your applications

If you didn't attend this workshop, as always, labs are [available](https://github.com/evgenyb/aks-workshops/tree/main/05-scaling-options-in-aks) and you are welcome to work with them.
