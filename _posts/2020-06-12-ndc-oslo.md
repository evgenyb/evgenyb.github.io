Last Friday I hold my first [NDC Oslo](https://ndcoslo.com/) talk about [Immutable Infrastructure on Azure](https://ndcoslo.com/talk/immutable-infrastructure-on-azure/)

How was it? I actually have a mixed feelings.
I was extremely nervous and super excited and since it was on-line I have no idea how I performed.
But it was definitely new and interesting experience.
