Today I held [Working with Azure Virtual Network Manager](https://www.meetup.com/infrastructure-as-code-user-group-oslo/events/310450544) Workshop under [Infrastructure as Code user group Oslo](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo).

This time we looked at different aspects aspects of working with `Azure Virtual Network Manager` and locked at:

- How to segment virtual networks with Network Groups
- How to implement hub-and-spoke and mesh network topology with AVNM
- How to secure virtual networks using AVNM rule-set
- How to route spoke-to-spoke traffic via Azure Firewall
- How to manage the IP addresses of virtual networks using AVNM IP Address Management (IPAM).

and much more...
