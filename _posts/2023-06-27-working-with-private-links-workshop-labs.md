Last month I held [Working with Azure Private Links](https://www.meetup.com/infrastructure-as-code-user-group-oslo/events/293893252/) workshop under my [Infrastructure as Code user group](https://www.meetup.com/Infrastructure-As-Code-User-Group-Oslo).

This time we looked at different aspects aspects of working with Azure Private Links and you will learn:

- What is Azure Private Link
- What is Azure Private Endpoint
- How Azure Private Link, Azure Private Endpoint, and Azure Private Link service work together to create private connections to Azure resources
- When to use Azure Private Link
- How to configure DNS settings for private endpoints
- How to implement Private Endpoint DNS Resolution with Azure DNS Private Resolver
- How to implement Azure VPN Gateway with P2S VPN connection to mimic on-prem to Azure connectivity

and many many more...
