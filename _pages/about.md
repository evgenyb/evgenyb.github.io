I am an Azure Solutions Architect Expert, Microsoft Azure Community and Content Hero, technical architect and developer with more than 30 years of experience, strong communication skills and love for automation.

I am currently working as a senior consultant at [Konsulentselskapet Ens≈ç AS](https://enso.no/).

I have a very strong development background working with complex distributed back-end systems at medium to big size enterprises in the financial sector. During the past 8 years, my focus has shifted towards Azure infrastructure, mainly because I feel that cloud infrastructure in general is becoming a central component of any IT. I believe that Azure, as a cloud provider, is one of the strongest players at the market.

Building up my Azure competence, I have completed all required certifications and became an [Azure Solutions Architect Expert](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-solutions-architect).
